# Serial-Monitor
This is a serial monitor script that I'm specifically using to record data from my microcontroller that is connected to an IMU. There is arduino code uploaded to the microcontroller that gets the orientation of the IMU as a quaternion, and this script is able to record that quaternion, convert it to euler angle, and then graph it in realtime.
